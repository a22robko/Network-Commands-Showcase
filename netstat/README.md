## 📡 `netstat -an`

The `netstat` (network statistics) command is used to display active network connections, listening ports, and network protocol statistics.

### 🔍 What it shows

- All current **TCP** and **UDP** connections.
- **Local and foreign IP addresses** and ports.
- The **state** of each connection (e.g., LISTENING, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT).

### 💡 When to use it

- 🛠️ To troubleshoot open or suspicious network connections.
- 📶 To see which ports your computer is **listening** on.
- 🧩 To detect malware or unknown network activity.
- 🔐 To verify if a server application is actually listening on a port.
